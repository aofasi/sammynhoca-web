# Sammynhoca Web

Sammynhoca is a snake game developed as a birthday present
to [Sammy](https://github.com/SammuelGR).
Feel free to lead a worm and **clear** the dirt,
growing up and earning sammoedas to buy **angel**ic items in the shop,
to make your worm prettier and better. It's an easy task at all, you won't
need any **manu**al.
